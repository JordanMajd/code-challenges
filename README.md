# Code Challenges

As a programmer, it is important to continue to challenge myself daily. The ability to problem solve is foundational to being an excellent developer. Understanding data structures and algorithms opens doors to new solutions and sheds light on alternative thought processes to solve problems. This repository serves as a place for me to improve on my understanding of:

- Algorithms.
- Data structures.
- Problem solving.

## Getting Started

Ensure node and npm are installed, then install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

To run a set of tests:

```sh
# run all tests
npm test

# run all tests for topic
npm test algorithms/sorting/

# run any test including binary_search
npm test binary_search

# run specific test
npm test binary_search_2.test.js
```

## Topics

### Algorithms
