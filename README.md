# Code Challenges

As a programmer, it is important to continue to challenge myself daily. The ability to problem solve is foundational to being an excellent developer. Understanding data structures and algorithms opens doors to new solutions. Different languages expose varying design paradigms and shed light on alternative thought processes to solve problems. This repository serves as a place for me to improve on my understanding of:

- Problem solving.
- Data structures.
- Algorithms.
- Languages & Paradigms.

Currently all code is written using Javascript. As I aggregate code, and projects from the last several years this repository will be reorganized to include solutions in other languages.

## Getting Started
