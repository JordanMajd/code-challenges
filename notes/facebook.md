## Technical Interview Process Process

1. Ask clarifying questions.
  - Should this be done be in place? (No additional memory)
  - Can we make any assumptions about the input?
  - Do we care more about performance or saving memory?
  - Are the integers passed into this problem all positive?
1. Analyze various solutions and tradeoffs.
  - Can be used to get hints, if you describe a few appraoches then ask, "Which approach do you think I should take?"
1. Plan solution with pseudocode.
  - Talk out loud.
1. Implement solution.
  - Talk out loud.
1. Test.
  - Test case is probably simple, be sure to ensure the test case covers edge cases
  - Write more tests, harder tests, comprehensive tests.

Example:

Given a sentence, return the number of occurrences for each letter in the alphabet.

1. Look at problem
1. Think of niave solution and identify the bottle neck
1. Look at data structures on how to address bottleneck
1. Look for twist, something that allows you to solve a problem more efficiently
1. Ask for help
